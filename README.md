# Projects
This folder contains some projects I have been wanting to create since before I graduated form Dev Bootcamp. I hope to complete these projects and revamp my development career after a few months of stress. 

I will relearn and apply

Rails - creating an app, MVC, CRUD, Scaffold, routing, and refreshing on built-in AJAX functionality, add, remove, and modify tables with migrations.

Devise and Pry - create a boilerplate file containing Device user authentication for quicker prototyping and pry for clear debugging.

CSS - master Block, Inline, Inline-block
    - specificity of elements
    - positioning of elements
    - master floats
    - box model
    - selectors
    - DRY coding concepts
    - use the browser debugger
    - Sass

Git - setting up a repository locally and on github containing all the projects.

Best of Luck to me, I know I can do this in one week.

There are a few projects, but today i can get started in the basic functionality of all of them, followed by some beautiful designing the next day, and for some of the more challenging ones this might take a bit longer, perhaps 2 or 3 weeks because they have some more advanced functionalities. 

After doing all this I will add all of these projects to my resume.

Make sure to commit a lot!
